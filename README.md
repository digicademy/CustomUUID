# CustomUUID Plugin for Oxygen XML Editor

A [Workspace Access Plugin](http://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-oxygen/index.html#concepts/workspace-access-plugin.html) for Oxygen XML Editor that creates TEI-conform UUIDs starting with a letter.

### Version
1.0.0

### Installation and Requirements

Needs Oxygen XML Editor version 16.1 or higher.

This Oxygen Workspace Access Plugin automatically resolves the custom editor variable `${customUUID}` in a UUID that starts with a letter.

IMPORTANT: So far only *one* UUID will be generated. If you are creating a file with more than one occurrence of this editor variable, all occurrences will be resolved in the *same* UUID.

A custom editor variable can be configured in the Oxygen *Preferences* page. For further information see the [Oxygen docs](http://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/#topics/custom-editor-variables.html).

*Local Usage:*
- navigate to Oxygen folder
- in folder */plugins* create a new folder *oxygen-plugin-customUUID* and add the file `plugin.xml`
- in the Oxygen folder go to */lib* directory and add the file `oxygen-plugin-customUUID-1.0.jar`

*Add-on:*

The following files are need for a deployment as an add-on:

- `oxygen-plugin-customUUID-1.0-plugin.jar`
- `extension.xml` for the update site, fill in the update site URL
- for further information see the [Oxygen help page](http://www.oxygenxml.com/addons.html).

### Usage

This Oxygen Plugin automatically resolves the custom editor variable `${customUUID}` in a UUID that starts with a letter. It employs an event listener that resolves this editor variable whenever it occurs.

#### Change the plugin

In order to resolve another custom editor variable, the search pattern in class `customUUIDResolver.java` has to be changed.
